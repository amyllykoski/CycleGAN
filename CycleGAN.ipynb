    "# CycleGAN, Image-to-Image Translation\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we're going to define and train a CycleGAN to read in an image from a set $X$ and transform it so that it looks as if it belongs in set $Y$. Specifically, we'll look at a set of images of [Yosemite national park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yosemite_National_Park) taken either during the summer of winter. The seasons are our two domains!\n",
    "\n",
    ">The objective will be to train generators that learn to transform an image from domain $X$ into an image that looks like it came from domain $Y$ (and vice versa). \n",
    "\n",

    "### Unpaired Training Data\n",
    "\n",
    "These images do not come with labels, but CycleGANs give us a way to learn the mapping between one image domain and another using an **unsupervised** approach. A CycleGAN is designed for image-to-image translation and it learns from unpaired training data. This means that in order to train a generator to translate images from domain $X$ to domain $Y$, we do not have to have exact correspondences between individual images in those domains. For example, in [the paper that introduced CycleGANs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10593), the authors are able to translate between images of horses and zebras, even though there are no images of a zebra in exactly the same position as a horse or with exactly the same background, etc. Thus, CycleGANs enable learning a mapping from one domain $X$ to another domain $Y$ without having to find perfectly-matched, training pairs!\n",

    "### CycleGAN and Notebook Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "A CycleGAN is made of two types of networks: **discriminators, and generators**. In this example, the discriminators are responsible for classifying images as real or fake (for both $X$ and $Y$ kinds of images). The generators are responsible for generating convincing, fake images for both kinds of images. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will detail the steps you should take to define and train such a CycleGAN. \n",
    "\n",
    ">1. You'll load in the image data using PyTorch's DataLoader class to efficiently read in images from a specified directory. \n",
    "2. Then, you'll be tasked with defining the CycleGAN architecture according to provided specifications. You'll define the discriminator and the generator models.\n",
    "3. You'll complete the training cycle by calculating the adversarial and cycle consistency losses for the generator and discriminator network and completing a number of training epochs. *It's suggested that you enable GPU usage for training.*\n",
    "4. Finally, you'll evaluate your model by looking at the loss over time and looking at sample, generated images.\n"

Deeper networks are more likely to have vanishing or exploding gradients and, therefore, have trouble reaching convergence; batch normalization helps with this a bit. However, during training, we often see that deep networks respond with a kind of training degradation. Essentially, the training accuracy stops improving and gets saturated at some point during training. In the worst cases, deep models would see their training accuracy actually worsen over time!\n",

    "**Image from [original paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10593) by Jun-Yan Zhu et. al.**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The CycleGAN contains two mapping functions $G: X \\rightarrow Y$ and $F: Y \\rightarrow X$, and associated adversarial discriminators $D_Y$ and $D_X$. **(a)** $D_Y$ encourages $G$ to translate $X$ into outputs indistinguishable from domain $Y$, and vice versa for $D_X$ and $F$.\n",
    "\n",
    "* To further regularize the mappings, we introduce two cycle consistency losses that capture the intuition that if\n",
    "we translate from one domain to the other and back again we should arrive at where we started. **(b)** Forward cycle-consistency loss and **(c)** backward cycle-consistency loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Least Squares GANs\n",
    "\n",
    "We've seen that regular GANs treat the discriminator as a classifier with the sigmoid cross entropy loss function. However, this loss function may lead to the vanishing gradients problem during the learning process. To overcome such a problem, we'll use a least squares loss function for the discriminator. This structure is also referred to as a least squares GAN or LSGAN, and you can [read the original paper on LSGANs, here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.04076.pdf). The authors show that LSGANs are able to generate higher quality images than regular GANs and that this loss type is a bit more stable during training! \n",
    "\n",
    "### Discriminator Losses\n",
    "\n",
    "The discriminator losses will be mean squared errors between the output of the discriminator, given an image, and the target value, 0 or 1, depending on whether it should classify that image as fake or real. For example, for a *real* image, `x`, we can train $D_X$ by looking at how close it is to recognizing and image `x` as real using the mean squared error:\n",

    "\n",
    "### Generator Losses\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculating the generator losses will look somewhat similar to calculating the discriminator loss; there will still be steps in which you generate fake images that look like they belong to the set of $X$ images but are based on real images in set $Y$, and vice versa. You'll compute the \"real loss\" on those generated images by looking at the output of the discriminator as it's applied to these _fake_ images; this time, your generator aims to make the discriminator classify these fake images as *real* images. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cycle Consistency Loss\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the adversarial losses, the generator loss terms will also include the **cycle consistency loss**. This loss is a measure of how good a reconstructed image is, when compared to an original image. \n",
    "\n",
    "Say you have a fake, generated image, `x_hat`, and a real image, `y`. You can get a reconstructed `y_hat` by applying `G_XtoY(x_hat) = y_hat` and then check to see if this reconstruction `y_hat` and the orginal image `y` match. For this, we recommed calculating the L1 loss, which is an absolute difference, between reconstructed and real images. You may also choose to multiply this loss by some weight value `lambda_weight` to convey its importance.\n",

    "A lot of experimentation goes into finding the best hyperparameters such that the generators and discriminators don't overpower each other. It's often a good starting point to look at existing papers to find what has worked in previous experiments, I'd recommend this [DCGAN paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06434.pdf) in addition to the original [CycleGAN paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.10593.pdf) to see what worked for them. Then, you can try your own experiments based off of a good foundation.\n",

    "#### Discriminator Losses\n",
    "\n",
    "When you display the generator and discriminator losses you should see that there is always some discriminator loss; recall that we are trying to design a model that can generate good \"fake\" images. So, the ideal discriminator will not be able to tell the difference between real and fake images and, as such, will always have some loss. You should also see that $D_X$ and $D_Y$ are roughly at the same loss levels; if they are not, this indicates that your training is favoring one type of discriminator over the and you may need to look at biases in your models or data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Generator Loss\n",
    "\n",
    "The generator's loss should start significantly higher than the discriminator losses because it is accounting for the loss of both generators *and* weighted reconstruction errors. You should see this loss decrease a lot at the start of training because initial, generated images are often far-off from being good fakes. After some time it may level off; this is normal since the generator and discriminator are both improving as they train. If you see that the loss is jumping around a lot, over time, you may want to try decreasing your learning rates or changing your cycle consistency loss to be a little more/less weighted.\n"

    "As you trained this model, you may have chosen to sample and save the results of your generated images after a certain number of training iterations. This gives you a way to see whether or not your Generators are creating *good* fake images. For example, the image below depicts real images in the $Y$ set, and the corresponding generated images during different points in the training process. You can see that the generator starts out creating very noisy, fake images, but begins to converge to better representations as it trains (though, not perfect).\n",

    "* One shortcoming of this model is that it produces fairly low-resolution images; this is an ongoing area of research; you can read about a higher-resolution formulation that uses a multi-scale generator model, in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.11585).\n",
    "* Relatedly, we may want to process these as larger (say 256x256) images at first, to take advantage of high-res data.\n",
    "* It may help your model to converge faster, if you initialize the weights in your network.\n",
    "* This model struggles with matching colors exactly. This is because, if $G_{YtoX}$ and $G_{XtoY}$ may change the tint of an image; the cycle consistency loss may not be affected and can still be small. You could choose to introduce a new, color-based loss term that compares $G_{YtoX}(y)$ and $y$, and $G_{XtoY}(x)$ and $x$, but then this becomes a supervised learning approach. \n",
    "* This unsupervised approach also struggles with geometric changes, like changing the apparent size of individual object in an image, so it is best suited for stylistic transformations.\n",
    "* For creating different kinds of models or trying out the Pix2Pix Architecture, [this Github repository](https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix/) which implements CycleGAN *and* Pix2Pix in PyTorch is a great resource.\n",

You'll just need to make sure that the data directories are named and organized correctly to load in that data."
