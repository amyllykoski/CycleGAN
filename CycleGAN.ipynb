    "# CycleGAN, Image-to-Image Translation\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we're going to define and train a CycleGAN to read in an image from a set $X$ and transform it so that it looks as if it belongs in set $Y$. Specifically, we'll look at a set of images of [Yosemite national park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yosemite_National_Park) taken either during the summer of winter. The seasons are our two domains!\n",
    "\n",
    ">The objective will be to train generators that learn to transform an image from domain $X$ into an image that looks like it came from domain $Y$ (and vice versa). \n",
    "\n",
    "Some examples of image data in both sets are pictured below.\n",

    "### Unpaired Training Data\n",
    "\n",
    "These images do not come with labels, but CycleGANs give us a way to learn the mapping between one image domain and another using an **unsupervised** approach. A CycleGAN is designed for image-to-image translation and it learns from unpaired training data. This means that in order to train a generator to translate images from domain $X$ to domain $Y$, we do not have to have exact correspondences between individual images in those domains. For example, in [the paper that introduced CycleGANs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10593), the authors are able to translate between images of horses and zebras, even though there are no images of a zebra in exactly the same position as a horse or with exactly the same background, etc. Thus, CycleGANs enable learning a mapping from one domain $X$ to another domain $Y$ without having to find perfectly-matched, training pairs!\n",

    "### CycleGAN and Notebook Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "A CycleGAN is made of two types of networks: **discriminators, and generators**. In this example, the discriminators are responsible for classifying images as real or fake (for both $X$ and $Y$ kinds of images). The generators are responsible for generating convincing, fake images for both kinds of images. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will detail the steps you should take to define and train such a CycleGAN. \n",
    "\n",
    ">1. You'll load in the image data using PyTorch's DataLoader class to efficiently read in images from a specified directory. \n",
    "2. Then, you'll be tasked with defining the CycleGAN architecture according to provided specifications. You'll define the discriminator and the generator models.\n",
    "3. You'll complete the training cycle by calculating the adversarial and cycle consistency losses for the generator and discriminator network and completing a number of training epochs. *It's suggested that you enable GPU usage for training.*\n",
    "4. Finally, you'll evaluate your model by looking at the loss over time and looking at sample, generated images.\n"

    "When you display the generator and discriminator losses you should see that there is always some discriminator loss; recall that we are trying to design a model that can generate good \"fake\" images. So, the ideal discriminator will not be able to tell the difference between real and fake images and, as such, will always have some loss. You should also see that $D_X$ and $D_Y$ are roughly at the same loss levels; if they are not, this indicates that your training is favoring one type of discriminator over the and you may need to look at biases in your models or data.\n",

    "The generator's loss should start significantly higher than the discriminator losses because it is accounting for the loss of both generators *and* weighted reconstruction errors. You should see this loss decrease a lot at the start of training because initial, generated images are often far-off from being good fakes. After some time it may level off; this is normal since the generator and discriminator are both improving as they train. If you see that the loss is jumping around a lot, over time, you may want to try decreasing your learning rates or changing your cycle consistency loss to be a little more/less weighted.\n"

    "* One shortcoming of this model is that it produces fairly low-resolution images; this is an ongoing area of research; you can read about a higher-resolution formulation that uses a multi-scale generator model, in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.11585).\n",
    "* Relatedly, we may want to process these as larger (say 256x256) images at first, to take advantage of high-res data.\n",
    "* It may help your model to converge faster, if you initialize the weights in your network.\n",
    "* This model struggles with matching colors exactly. This is because, if $G_{YtoX}$ and $G_{XtoY}$ may change the tint of an image; the cycle consistency loss may not be affected and can still be small. You could choose to introduce a new, color-based loss term that compares $G_{YtoX}(y)$ and $y$, and $G_{XtoY}(x)$ and $x$, but then this becomes a supervised learning approach. \n",
    "* This unsupervised approach also struggles with geometric changes, like changing the apparent size of individual object in an image, so it is best suited for stylistic transformations.\n",
    "* For creating different kinds of models or trying out the Pix2Pix Architecture, [this Github repository](https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix/) which implements CycleGAN *and* Pix2Pix in PyTorch is a great resource.\n",

    "**Once you are satified with your model, you are ancouraged to test it on a different dataset to see if it can find different types of mappings!**\n",

    "### Different datasets for download\n",
    "\n",
    "You can download a variety of datasets used in the Pix2Pix and CycleGAN papers, by following instructions in the [associated Github repository](https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix/blob/master/README.md). You'll just need to make sure that the data directories are named and organized correctly to load in that data."
